# Rainfall_prediction_project

Motivation and Description

Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. This project aims to predict whether it will rain the next day using historical weather data from various locations across Australia. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, this project strives to provide reliable short-term rainfall predictions.

Dataset

The dataset contains approximately 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia. The target variable for this project is RainTomorrow, indicating whether it rained the next day. A value of Yes means the rainfall was 1mm or more, and No means less than 1mm.

Methodology

1.Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
2.Feature Engineering: Add a new feature representing the season based on the month of observation.
3.Seasonal Clustering: Cluster data points based on seasonal patterns and train separate models for each cluster.
4.Model Training: Use a Random Forest Classifier to predict RainTomorrow.
5.Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and other relevant metrics.

Results and Evaluation

The model was evaluated based on accuracy and other metrics. The addition of seasonal clustering improved the model's ability to capture seasonal variations in rainfall patterns, leading to more accurate predictions.

Visualizations

Visualizations included in the project:
1.Distribution of rainfall across different seasons
2.Feature importance from the Random Forest model
3.Actual vs. Predicted rainfall
